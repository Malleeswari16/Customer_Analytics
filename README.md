# Customer_Analytics

Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto states that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes, this is known as the 80/20 rule or Pareto principle
Similarly, 80% of companies business comes from 20% customers. Companies must identify those top customers and maintain a relationship with them to ensure continuous revenue. To maintain a long-term relationship with customers, companies must schedule loyalty schemes such as discounts, offers, coupons, bonus points, and gifts. In today’s competitive business landscape, understanding customers’ behavior and optimizing customer acquisition strategies are crucial for sustainable growth. This data analysis project aims to uncover valuable insights to inform decision-making and improve business strategies.

In the analysis, I have adept two good prediction algorithms for CLTV Prediction.
1. Beta-Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution - BD/NBD model
2. Gamma Gamma Model

Customer lifetime Value(CLTV):
"Customer Lifetime Value is a monetary value that represents the amount of revenue or profit a customer will give the company over the period of the relationship"

Basically, these models help to identify the Customer total revenue generated(will generate) how many transactions where made(will made), and how frequently they were made using RFM analysis.
